# Tax homework
# Given the “gross” salary of a person, calculate the “net”.
# Constraints
    #If the gross is less than 1000, then the income tax is 10%
    #If the gross is less than 2000, then the income tax is 12%
    #If the gross is less than 4000, then the income tax is 14%
    #If the gross is more than 4000, then the income tax is 18%
    #If the gross is less than 2000, every child gets you a tax cut of 1%
    #If the gross is more than 2000, every child gets you a tax cut of 0.5%

# Instructions
# Read the “gross” and the number of children
# Print the “net”
# Use try/except when reading the inputs

    elif gross < 1000:
        print(f"Your income tax is 10%; therefore your net salary is {gross * (0.9 + children * 0.01)} ")
